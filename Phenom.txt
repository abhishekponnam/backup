Sure, here is the pseudocode solution for the distance calculator engine:

```python
def calculate_shortest_route(start_station, end_station, routes):
  """
  Calculates the shortest route between the start station and the end station.

  Args:
    start_station: The start station.
    end_station: The end station.
    routes: A list of routes between stations.

  Returns:
    The shortest route between the start station and the end station.
  """

  # Validate the input data.
  if start_station not in routes or end_station not in routes:
    raise ValueError("Invalid start or end station")

  shortest_distance = float("inf")

  # Iterate over all the routes.
  for route in routes:

    current_distance = 0

    # Add the start station to the current route.
    current_route.append(start_station)

This pseudocode solution first validates the input data from the API endpoint. Then, it calculates the shortest route between the start station and the end station. Finally, it posts the shortest route to the API endpoint.
